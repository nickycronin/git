                It all started in 2005. After a lot of discussion Dave
                (aka Diggler) &amp; Malc (aka Squaddie - in the 2005
                Banner above) and a few others, put a programme
                together, unfortunately Malc, who was the driving force
                behind the weekend and other events like Barracks,
                passed away in July that year. In order to keep things
                going David (aka Diggler) roped in Terry (aka Gnasher)
                so that the event could go ahead in his memory.<br>
                <br>
                Since the first event we've welcomed lads from across
                the UK, Europe and USA. As the first event went well we
                continued into 2006 and gradually developed the event
                and in 2007 started working with <a
                  href="http://www.lgf.org.uk/">LGF</a>. The following
                year <a href="http://www.bleachers.co.uk/">Bleachers
                  &amp; Co</a> and <a
                  href="http://www.rob.eu/manchester/">RoB Manchester</a>
                sponsor the event to help fund some of the promotion
                material including flyers, posters, weekend guide and
                provide prizes.<br>
                <br>
                After the 2007 Weekend it was decided to move the event
                from September to June as we wanted to try and avoid
                clashing with Party Conference Season and Football
                fixtures as lads were finding it tough to get hotel
                rooms. Despite what you might hear Manchester can be
                very hot in June - not just coz loads of Skins descend
                on the city, 2010 temperatures hit 32C on the Saturday
                which proved tough in Boots &amp; MA1's!<br>
                <br>
                We decided to have a photoshoot using local volunteers
                in 2008, which would give us our own pics to use on this
                site and our other groups on <a
                  href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ManchesterSkins/">Yahoo</a>,
                <a href="http://www.gayromeo.com/manchester_skins">Gayromeo</a>
                and more recently <a
href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_100383356720148&amp;ap=1">Facebook</a>.
                However the first one was in February and that proved a
                bit of a challenge for the volunteers since it was only
                a degree or two above freezing! Some of the posters and
                flyers are shown on this page from the first Banner to
                the flyer that was a favorite with many Skins - the 2009
                Skinhead Piss pic that was a survivor from a photoshoot
                we did one very cold afternoon. We were a bit luckier in
                2010 and it was a bit warmer. We'll be doing another one
                this year so watch out for details.<br>
                <br>
                The scene in Manchester has changed a lot since we first
                started and the weekend has evolved and grown to take
                this into account. Last year (2010) we visited the <a
                  href="http://www.eaglemanchester.com/home.aspx">Eagle</a>
                for the first time and they featured again in the&nbsp;
                2011 weekend only this time we had the run of the Black
                Eagle for part of&nbsp; both nights. As we try and keep
                things fresh a new competition, <a
                  href="http://www.oi-skinhead.com/stomping.html">Strictly


                  Stomping</a>, was organised by Steve of <a
                  href="http://www.promo729.net/">Promo729</a>. More new
                things for 2011 included banners &amp; polo shirts which
                proved a big hit and we are looking at getting them on
                sale soon. The logo and graphics were designed by Dazz
                who also created mousemats and calanders too.<br>
              </big><big> <br>
                Aside from getting Gay Skinheads together we've always
                been a not for profit group and since we started we've
                raised &pound;2007 for local charities LGF,<a
                  href="http://www.ght.org.uk/"> George House Trust</a>
                and <a href="http://www.bpnw.org.uk/">BP North West</a>.
                To raise this we've polished Boots, had raffles, rattled
                buckets and tins. <br>
                <br>
                Thanks to everyone who has been involved since we
                started the Manchester Gay Skins events including <a
